## Introduction
<p align="justify">The title of our project is ‘Futuristic City View & Smart Fire Management System’. In this project
we tried to implement the view of how a futuristic city will be look like and how will be the fire
management system in future. There are three scenarios in the project. The first scenario is of a
city where we have the next version of all the components of a city like futuristic bullet trains,
cars, and buildings. There is underground train station. Also there are futuristic cars and smart cars
as well. Animated ballons moving in the sky is also designed. Robots will be used very often in
the future. So , there are some robots in the first scenario in the underground train station. We
added animations to these objects in order to look more realistic. Then we will have the second
scenario. In the second scenario, we designed a futuristic Fire Station. We replicated the view of
the next version fire station. There are be vehicles such as fire trucks and helicopters in the fire
station. Again there is animation in the scenario. Then we will have our third scenario. The third
scenario is also a scenario of a modern futuristic city. However, the design and components of the
third scenario is completely different from the first scenario. In the third scenario there are smart
cars, modern bullet train, and modern buildings. There are also futuristic flying car. Moving
animation is also added to all of the objects. Flower with leaf’s moving is also designed in this
scenario. This looks so realistic. The main part of this scenario is that one of the buildings will get
fire. To extinguish the fire, A helicopter will come from the fire station and will begin to extinguish
the fire with rain effect. So, in this scenario, fire effect, automatic helicopter movement, rain effect
is used. The main objective of our project is to replicate a futuristic city view and to show the view
of how the fire management system will look in the near future.</p>

## Technologies used:
<p align="justify"> We used opengl to create the entire project. We used different features of Opengl like lines,
polygon, circle drawing, moving animations, rotation animation. We used Geogebra online
graphing tool to graph the entire project. We took help from some of the online websites like
freepik, Shutterstock to search for vectors and designs. BMP pictures and textures are also used in
the project </p>
